* Features added :
    - Timer + Count how many cards are flipped
    - Two deck of cards

* I need to add several improvements and features this is the next step : add rainbow & sparkles in case of victory / add malus card : pick it up and all the card are shuffle or add bonus card : 3 same card to find but only one time etc ...
